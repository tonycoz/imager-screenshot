	- ignore some VC++ generated junk in MANIFEST.SKIP
	- avoid some Makefile.PL warnings
	- use Imager in Makefile.PL since I'd prefer to error on that
	  rather than Imager::ExtUtils
	- work around Debian strangeness
	- the x11 capture wasn't releasing the XImage or the line
	  and color buffers.
	- x11_open() incorrectly reset the error handler to junk
	- Makefile.PL was checking /usr/X11R6 for headers instead of 
	  /usr/X11R6/include
	- add header directories as -I flags if we find a header in
	  them
	- avoid duplicate -L flags

	- README was missing
	- updated my EU::MM and I now set the LICENSE key so it's set
	  in META.yml
